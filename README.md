  ## Description 
  Being able to build a portfolio with React has been a challenge, but fun at the same time! Having a portfolio where I am able to dispaly my projects, list the different languages I know and giving people the option to message me if interested in having a website built. A React portfolio also gives future employers the option to check out my work and see if I would be a good fit for their company.
